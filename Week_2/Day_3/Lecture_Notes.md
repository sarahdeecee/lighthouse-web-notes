## Rules of Networking
---
### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

Computer A | Computer B
--- | ---
- Want to connect with B
- Want to know where B is
- Want to show credentials to B
- Want to receive messages from B
- Certain messages from B will make me do specific operations
- Want to be able to disconnect
---
Once we connect, we stay connected, and disconnect at the end.

## HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
Computer A | Computer B
--- | ---
- Want to connect with B
- Want to know where B is
- Want to show credentials to B
- A sends a **request** (a single message)
- B sents a **response** (a single message back)
- Computers disconnect

## IP (Global and Local)
IP is an address
Local IP is an addres that is used on **your own network** and it's a way the router knows who you are on the network and will send you information accordingly

### Global IP
- Your actual address (location)
- (VPN) <---> Masks your location

## Routers
## Ports
If Local IP are your buildings, **ports** are your unit numbers.
Each program has its own port.
